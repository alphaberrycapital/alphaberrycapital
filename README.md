AlphaBerry - An evolving asset management team with in-depth research and development expertise in both traditional and crypto financial markets.

We develop and implement a comprehensive set of proprietary investment solutions tailored to optimize our own trading strategies and risk management. These solutions are designed to enhance our internal performance across a wide range of assets and markets.

Market Making

We actively provide liquidity across a diversified range of DeFi protocols, leveraging our expertise to ensure efficient capital allocation and liquidity provision. In CeFi, we deploy a market-neutral strategy, systematically exploiting inefficiencies while minimizing directional risk. This dual approach enhances yield potential while maintaining capital preservation as a core objective.

Quantitative Approach

We leverage advanced algorithms and statistical models to identify and exploit market inefficiencies. We identify and utilize predictive factors (alphas) through statistical analysis, machine learning models, and alternative data sources. 

Research & Data Science

Our Research and Data Science team continuously innovates, leveraging advanced analytics and cutting-edge methodologies to uncover new opportunities and enhance existing strategies. By relentlessly refining our models and exploring alternative data sources, we remain at the forefront of market intelligence, driving alpha generation and maintaining our competitive edge.
